# werewolves-narrator-helper.neocities.org
Hello user! This project is a work in progress, with two simple objectives:
1. Create a command-line based application that will aid narrators in the playing of the game Werewolves.
2. Take that command-line application and turn it into a full fleshed web application GUI, based on HTML5/CSS and JavaScript.

Although simple, this is no easy task and will continue to be a WIP until I can't think of anything else to add.
I created this for my own personal use, as I couldn't find any tool like it in order to help me do what I wanted to do.
Feel free to download and use any part of the tool you find useful, I only ask that you credit me, Ford Powers, as the author.

Thanks, enjoy!
