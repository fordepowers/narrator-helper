# [werewolves-narrator-helper.neocities.org](https://werewolves-narrator-helper.neocities.org/)
> This project is now finished, as it had two simple objectives:
1. Create a command-line based application that will aid narrators in the playing of the game Werewolves.
2. Take that command-line application and turn it into a web application, based on HTML5/CSS and JavaScript.

I created this for my own personal use, as I couldn't find any tool like it in order to help me do what I wanted to do.
Feel free to download and use any part of the tool you find useful, I only ask that you credit me, Ford Powers, as the author.

## What's Next
I'm currently working on two new React apps based on the same game, werewolves.
One will involve all players and be a multiplayer platform-agnostic game.
The other will be a GUI version of the current website.
If you are interested in contributing to those, the repos are linked below.

Thanks, and enjoy.
