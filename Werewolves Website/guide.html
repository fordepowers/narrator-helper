                is a party game. It was first invented in the 1970s by a Russian professor of psychology, Dmitri
                Davidov, as an experiment in group psychology. Since then, it has been developed and codified by
                students at Princeton University under the name &lsquo;Mafia&rsquo;. Depending on your perspective,
                Werewolf is a study of interactions in a situation where there is an informed minority and an uninformed
                majority; or a study of group dynamics in an atmosphere of mistrust; or an experiment in mass hysteria.
                First and foremost, however, it is an intriguing, challenging and enjoyable co-operative party game.

                game is set in a small, isolated 19th-century village that has no contact with the outside world. Most
                of the residents are innocent Villagers, but a few are also secretly other roles. By night, the
                Werewolves roam about the village, picking a law-abiding Villager as their victim and devouring him or
                her. By day, the Villagers gather together, seeking justice, and may vote to execute one of their number
                in an attempt to eradicate the threat. The Werewolves (and other roles) form one team: they win if they
                manage to kill all the Villagers. The Villagers (and other roles) form the other team: they win if they
                manage to kill all the Werewolves. To add some intrigue to the game, there is also certain roles who
                work neutrally for their own gain. Finally, one player (you) is a Narrator. As Narrator, you are neither
                a Werewolf nor a Villager, but a neutral referee that facilitates the game.</span></p>

                    player roles. Roles are assigned secretly, so that each player knows his own role but nobody
                    else&rsquo;s. The best way to accomplish this is using a deck of appropriately labelled cards. The
                    Narrator simply deals one card facedown to each player, and each player looks at his own card to
                    find out his assigned role. Alternatively, the Narrator can choose Roles on the first night,
                    selecting people by touching them while everyone is asleep.</span></li>

                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The
                game proceeds in rounds. Each round is divided into two phases: night and day. Each round begins with
                night. During the night, the village goes to sleep; all players bow their heads and close their eyes. As
                the night goes on, the Narrator awakens each Role and has them perform their task. After the night is
                over, the Narrator dictates to the town what events took place last night. Then, the day begins; all
                non-eliminated players vote on who to execute. Immediately after the trial is over, a new round
                begins.</span></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span

                Narrator, it&rsquo;s your job to announce nightfall and daybreak, and to give instructions in between.
                It will also help if you remind new players of the need to stay as silent as possible, to make quick
                decisions, and to pay attention when you communicate with them &ndash; because there are very few
                circumstances in which they will be able to ask for clarification without giving themselves away!
            </span></p>

        </h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Everyone
                closes their eyes and bows their heads. The app will prompt you for each role (if they are alive) so
                don&rsquo;t worry about forgetting someone. When the prompt shows up, say: &ldquo;(Character),
                awake.&rdquo; The Character depending on their role, must silently fulfill their job for the night. If
                their role involves choosing other players, they must choose one sleeping player and then identify their
                choice to you, probably by pointing or nodding in his/her direction so that you understand which player
                is being identified. They need to do this without revealing themselves by giving away audible clues to
                the sleeping Villagers. If they can&rsquo;t decide after a few seconds or if you can&rsquo;t work out
                who is being identified, you can prompt them audible to be more specific. After a decision is made and
                the role for that night is complete, say: &ldquo;(Character), asleep.&rdquo; Do this for every role that
                is prompted by you from the game. Once it prints off the events for the night (i.e it says &ldquo;Last
                night,&rdquo;), the night is over. </span></p>
        <h2 style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt; text-align: left;"><span
                style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #575757; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Daybreak</span>
        </h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">All
                players open their eyes. The game will give you a readout of the events of the night, not all of them
                are relevant to the players. You as the Narrator interpret the events and relay them to the player base,
                explaining who died and from what. Those players are now eliminated (see later). </span></p>
        <h2 style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt; text-align: left;"><span
                style="font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-family: Arial; color: #575757; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Day</span>
        </h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Day
                follows after the Daybreak. During the day, (non-eliminated) players discuss the events of the preceding
                night and debate who should be in an attempt to catch the Werewolves. Unlike night, the structure of day
                is very free. As Narrator, you should encourage players to talk freely, voicing suspicions and asking
                questions of each other. If the players are new to the game, you may also want to explain how executing
                works (see below) and give some general tactical advice. Other than that, you shouldn&rsquo;t need to
                intervene until a group consensus starts to appear. When you notice the beginnings of a consensus, with
                clear suspicions being voiced about one or more players, interrupt the discussion to ask the group
                whether they are ready to accuse someone. In order to proceed to the vote, an accusation needs to be
                proposed and seconded by a different players. If this is achieved, then all (non-eliminated) players
                vote on the question &lsquo;Should we execute this player?&rsquo;. If a simple majority of players votes
                Yes, then the accused player is executed and immediately eliminated from the game. If a majority vote
                No, then the accusation fails and debate may continue. The day ends immediately when a player has been
                executed. It also ends immediately, without a execution, if three successive accusations all fail to
                muster a majority. When day ends, a new round begins, starting with nightfall. </span></p>
        <h2><span>Eliminated Players </span></h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">A
                player who is killed for any reason is eliminated. Eliminated players can stay in the room and watch the
                game &ndash; including keeping their eyes open at night, if they wish &ndash; but they may not
                contribute in any way to the game, either by communicating in any way with the people around them or by
                voting. Once again, they are to remain SILENT while eliminated. </span></p>
        <h2><span>Winning The Game </span></h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The
                game is won when either the last member of the Werewolf team is eliminated (in which case the Villager
                team wins) or the last Villager team member is eliminated (in which case the Werewolves team wins). Note
                that a victory for either team is shared by all members of that team, whether or not they were
                eliminated. </span></p>
        <h2><span>The Turning-Point </span></h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">It
                follows that there is a turning-point in the game, beyond which the situation becomes hopeless for the
                Villagers. That turning-point is reached if, at the end of any day, there is only one more Villager than
                the number of Werewolves (or if the numbers are equal). When this happens, the Werewolves will devour
                another Villager overnight, removing the Villagers&rsquo; majority. It&rsquo;s normal for the Narrator
                to award a victory to the Werewolves if this situation arises. It&rsquo;s also conventional,
                particularly with new players, for you as Narrator to point out when such a turning-point is imminent.
                At the start of any day, if the number of Villagers is only one or two higher than the number of
                Werewolves, you should explain that the upcoming vote is crucial. If the Villagers execute the wrong
                person, they will hand the game to the Werewolves.</span></p>
        <h2><span>Advice For New Players </span></h2>
        <p><span
                style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">As
                Narrator, it&rsquo;s your job to provide hints for players who are new to the game. Before the game run
                through the following hints: </span></p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: left;">
            <li
                style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">
                <span
                    style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Don&rsquo;t
                    take things too seriously! The whole point is that players are forced to take decisions based on
                    insufficient information, and so it&rsquo;s likely that some people will be treated unfairly. If
                    this happens to you, roll with it, and don&rsquo;t blame the others. It&rsquo;s just the way things
                    go. It&rsquo;s only a game!</span></li>
            <li
                style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">

                    in it for the game!</span></li>
            <li

                        we&rsquo;ll probably play more than one game, so you&rsquo;ll get your chance.</span></li>

                        it&rsquo;s just as much fun being dead as alive. When you&rsquo;re dead, you can watch
                        everything that happens, and you&rsquo;re allowed to share in the secrets that the surviving
                        players don&rsquo;t know about.</span></li>
                <li

                        it&rsquo;s a team game! If your team wins, you win, even if you didn&rsquo;t survive until the
                        end of the game.</span></li>

                    a Werewolf &ndash; and the last thing you want is to attract suspicion from your fellow

                    talk! Sharing information &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s just random suspicions &ndash; is the only way
                    you are ever going to win. Listen carefully to what everyone else says. And if anyone seems a bit
                    too quiet, find out why.</span></li>

                    Girl, be careful! You&rsquo;re the most valuable member of the Villagers&rsquo; team. The
                    information you gather each round will make the difference between success and failure. But be
                    careful what you do with it. If you reveal your identity outright, the Werewolves will be on you
                    like a shot. And remember that anyone could claim to be the Little Girl&hellip;</span></li>

                    use the daytime well! Manipulate the discussions as best you can. If you can get an innocent
                    Villager executed, then that doubles your kill rate. Also, use this time to identify your future
                    prey. Does anyone seem a bit too clever? </span></li>
